    	<h2>Professional Self-Assesment</h2>
    	<p>
        	Throughout the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I have gained technical skills in programming, database management, and web development, while also gaining soft skills such as problem solving, computational thinking, and a systems mindset. The versatility of the program and broad standards allowed me to tailor the program in a direction that suited my goals. Specifically, I plan to pursue robotics in the future and with a background in applications and algorithm development, I should be well prepared for the field of robotic software.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        	Beyond the normal aspects of Computer Science, I have learned how to communicate effectively within the technology sector. This includes conveying software requirements, goals, and designs to stakeholders and clients in a manner that they will understand. Also, being able to express advanced ideas and thoughts to team members is essential in an environment as complex as software engineering. With these ideas, new terminology will arise, and I may need to create new terminology. Understanding current terminology is essential to establishing new methods of communication that can be traced and contextualized. Many projects helped in building such a vocabulary, but the ones that stand out are the computer graphics project and my unit testing project. The graphics project introduced ideas and terms such as “rasterization” or the fundamental idea that all computer graphics are composed of triangles as the base shape while the testing project introduced me to unit testing.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        	There are three aspects of Computer Science that are emphasized the most in this program, and they are “Data Structures and Algorithms,” “Software Engineering,” and “Databases.” These three focal points are at the heart of the Computer Science program and teach the fundamentals of computation through their utilization. Data structures and algorithms cover the manipulation of data and the processes that handle said manipulation. Software engineering is the application of Computer Science, specifically algorithmic design and implementation for innovative uses of information. Databases focus on the short- and long-term storage of information for data analysis or future access.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        	Beyond the normal, more pronounced focuses of Computer Science, there is an underlying subject that is just as important, if not more: a security mindset. A security mindset is crucial when dealing with all aspects of Computer Science and should never be overlooked regardless of project goals. Maintaining a security mindset requires practice and constant research into the minds of those who wish to violate that security. Security can also range anywhere from manually encrypting large data sets to ensuring that all dependencies and/or software is up to date. One of my projects focused on keeping me in a security mindset by outlining an entire security plan and protocol for the development of a system.
   	</p>
    	<p>
        	To sum up my accomplishments, hard work, and skill sets, I have set up three enhancement examples over two projects from my Computer Science program. Demonstrating a proficiency in software engineering and design is my first project, a mobile inventory application. This enhancement was to introduce new functionality to the application, hence, “engineering.” The next enhancement was implemented on the same inventory application project, integrating new database technologies into the mobile application. Finally, the data structures and algorithms section displays my ability to craft complex data structures from scratch. For this last enhancement, I added a comparison data structure for sorting data.

        <h2>Artifacts</h2>
        <h3>Inventory Application</h3>
        <a href="https://github.com/cbeavers1/InventoryApplication">Inventory Git</a>
        <div class="image-container">

        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Description</h4>
                <p> This artifact is an inventory application designed to be ambiguous in nature, having the ability to store any kind of item with simply a name, description, quantity, and photo. 
                    The basic application is a base structure to showcase the idea, which can later be customized to client needs. The application currently allows for user creation and login with minimal security implementation. 
                    Security will be applied in a future iteration that will be explained in depth later. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Software Engineering and Design</h4>
                <p> The first enhancement to the inventory application covered the topic of Software Engineering and Design. 
                    The enhancement involved introducing the ability to add a photo to accompany each item in the inventory, optionally. Adding this functionality involved creating a new “view” or display area for the image under the item’s details page, adding a camera button to access the device’s camera for getting the image, and developing a connection between the fragments that ultimately sends the data to the database. 
                    To transport data out of the details fragment to the ultimate destination of the database, I created a bundle of data that is listened for in the inventory’s main fragment. 
                    After which, I called a custom database CRUD function to update the items photo data in the database. 
                </p>
            </li>
                 
            <li>
                <h4>Databases</h4>
                <p>The second enhancement involves integrating a cloud database into the application instead of an SQLite database. 
                    Originally, the goal was to integrate MongoDB, however, as of this year, MongoDB for mobile applications has been deprecated. 
                    I decided to use Google’s version of a cloud hosted database called Firebase. 
                    The total application uses two databases, one for users and another for the items stored. 
                    Currently the only database updated is the items database which is now static in the cloud and can be shared across devices. 
                    However, the user database used for authentication to the application and overall access, has not yet been updated to this cloud platform. Future iterations are being developed with this implementation. 
                    Adding this database to the artifact is actually quite simple, thanks to Google. First, I had to set up an account and register my app with Firebase. Once doing this I simply downloaded the SDK and JSON document provided for my specific project. Placing the documents in the right place amongst the hierarchy of files allows the application to connect to the database with a stable internet connection. 
                    The final step involves creating CRUD functions to manipulate the data from the database.

        <h3>Course Schedule Application</h3>
        <a href="https://github.com/cbeavers1/Data-Structures-Algorithms-">CourseApp Git</a>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Description</h4>
                <p> Artifact two for my project is an application used to display a list of courses, a sample schedule, in order from first to last in the series. 
                    The application initially utilized a BST, binary search tree, to store the classes in a pre-ordered fashion with access functions that allow for accessing a single course or a list of them all in the form of the sample schedule. 
                    The algorithm utilizes Create, Read, Update, and Delete functions per coding standards when interacting with data structures. 
                    It also introduces a pointer structure called Node that points to information depending on which part of the tree is being accessed. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Data Structures and Algorithms</h4>
                <p> The enhancement I chose to make is to add a hash table from scratch that also stores and prints the course data. 
                    A hash table should be able to return the data faster than a BST in the same format with a more intuitive form of organization. 
                    To create this hash table, I initialize a list with a set of pointers. 
                    When data is loaded, a hash function finds the array index for the course. 
                    The pointers at this index are then traversed until the inserting course’s number is less than the next course in the list or the next one is null. 
                    At this point the new node is inserted into the linked list. 
                    Each custom CRUD function was then required to manipulate and further access the data stored in the new hash table. 
                </p>
