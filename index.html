    	<h2>Professional Self-Assesment</h2>
    	<p>
        	Throughout the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I have gained technical skills in programming, database management, and web development, while also gaining soft skills such as problem solving, computational thinking, and a systems mindset. The versatility of the program and broad standards allowed me to tailor the program in a direction that suited my goals. Specifically, I plan to pursue robotics in the future and with a background in applications and algorithm development, I should be well prepared for the field of robotic software.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        	Beyond the normal aspects of Computer Science, I have learned how to communicate effectively within the technology sector. This includes conveying software requirements, goals, and designs to stakeholders and clients in a manner that they will understand. Also, being able to express advanced ideas and thoughts to team members is essential in an environment as complex as software engineering. With these ideas, new terminology will arise, and I may need to create new terminology. Understanding current terminology is essential to establishing new methods of communication that can be traced and contextualized. Many projects helped in building such a vocabulary, but the ones that stand out are the computer graphics project and my unit testing project. The graphics project introduced ideas and terms such as “rasterization” or the fundamental idea that all computer graphics are composed of triangles as the base shape while the testing project introduced me to unit testing.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        	There are three aspects of Computer Science that are emphasized the most in this program, and they are “Data Structures and Algorithms,” “Software Engineering,” and “Databases.” These three focal points are at the heart of the Computer Science program and teach the fundamentals of computation through their utilization. Data structures and algorithms cover the manipulation of data and the processes that handle said manipulation. Software engineering is the application of Computer Science, specifically algorithmic design and implementation for innovative uses of information. Databases focus on the short- and long-term storage of information for data analysis or future access.
    	</p>
    	<p>
        	Beyond the normal, more pronounced focuses of Computer Science, there is an underlying subject that is just as important, if not more: a security mindset. A security mindset is crucial when dealing with all aspects of Computer Science and should never be overlooked regardless of project goals. Maintaining a security mindset requires practice and constant research into the minds of those who wish to violate that security. Security can also range anywhere from manually encrypting large data sets to ensuring that all dependencies and/or software is up to date. One of my projects focused on keeping me in a security mindset by outlining an entire security plan and protocol for the development of a system.
   	</p>
    	<p>
        	To sum up my accomplishments, hard work, and skill sets, I have set up three enhancement examples over two projects from my Computer Science program. Demonstrating a proficiency in software engineering and design is my first project, a mobile inventory application. This enhancement was to introduce new functionality to the application, hence, “engineering.” The next enhancement was implemented on the same inventory application project, integrating new database technologies into the mobile application. Finally, the data structures and algorithms section displays my ability to craft complex data structures from scratch. For this last enhancement, I added a comparison data structure for sorting data.
